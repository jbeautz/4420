##Exercise 1

##Exercise 2
(a) There are $q^n$ was to choose $n$ elements out of the $q$ possibilities in the field.  
But to create a subspace we should only consider the $q^n-1$ possibilities not including all all $0$ elements for the $n$ elements.  

Now, there are $q-1$ ways to multiply a vector by a nonzero scalar in $F_q$.  

Hence, for each one dimensional vector in $F_q$ there are ${q^n-q}\over q-1$ forms.  
This defines $(n) = 1 + ... + q^{n-1}$.  

Now that we have adjusted for the finite field with $q$ elements, we can consider this problem in the standard sense of choosing $k$ linearly independent vectors to form a $k$ dimensional space in $F^n$.  

The number of ways to do this is the standard $n\choose k$ formula but with the $q^n-1\over q-1$ forms of each vector selected in $F_q$ we have the given formula.  

(b)  
Consider any $n$ linearly independent vectors which span $F^n$. Form a $k\times n$ matrix such that the entries to each column index the $n$ linearly independent vectors such that each column denotes a $k$-dimensional subspace spanned by $k$ out of the $n$ vectors.
