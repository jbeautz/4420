Assume this interval of $L$ does not satisfy the property of semimodularity. For semimodularity to hold for the lattice, all 4 points must have the following relation. If $a,b$ cover $c$ then $d$ covers $a$ and $b$.  We need to find 5 points such that $a,b$ cover $c$ but there exists a point $e$ such that $d$ covers $a$ but $e$ is between $d$ and $b$.  

We know $L$ satisfies this property in general. Hence, if there existed 5 points like $a,b,c,d,e$ then $L$ would not satisfy semimodularity in general. This is a contradiction.  

Therefore this interval of the lattice must be semimodular.
